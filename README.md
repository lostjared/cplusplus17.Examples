# cplusplus17.Examples

This section serves as a repository where, over time, I'll be incorporating various examples to facilitate learning the latest features introduced in C++17.

The initiative commenced in July 2017.

For compilation, ensure that your compiler is compatible with C++17. On Linux/Mac, execute the following command within the directory containing the code:

```bash
make
```

Additionally, this area includes a selection of miscellaneous example projects.
